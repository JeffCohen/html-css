Homework Instructions
========

Assuming you:

1. Have a free GitHub app
2. Have installed the GitHub App for Mac or Windows
3. Have signed into GitHub

Then:

1. Click the "Fork" button in the upper-right corner of this page.  This will create a duplicate copy of this entire repository under your account.
2. Now, your page should say "Your Name / html-css" at the top instead of "mpcs52553/html-css".
3. Next, let's get the code down to your laptop.  Click "Clone in Desktop" in the lower-right of this page.  That should trigger your GitHub App to start up and sync the code down to your laptop.
4. Modify the `homework.html` file so that it looks (roughly) like `homework.png`.  Please don't duplicate the exact text - you should use some content that's interesting to you - but the general layout should be the same.


Here is the HTML guide I mentioned in class:

# Grading

Your code will be judged on:

1. Is it s a valid HTML 5 document (has proper doctype, html, head, and body elements)?
2. Do elements have proper open and closing tags?
3. Are you using the Arial font (or another font of your choosing)?
3. Does it look (roughly) similar in structure to the goal?

# Hints

In order to complete the challenge, here are some HTML elements and CSS properties that might help.   You don't need all of these.  There are many ways to solve it, so I'm just throwing out some examples.

## HTML Elements That Might Be Handy

* `ol`
* `ul`
* `li`
* `p`
* `h1`
* `h1`
* `header`
* `footer`

## Some CSS Properties That Might Be Handy

* `font-family`
* `border`
* `background-color`
* `color`
